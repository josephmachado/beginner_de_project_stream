# Setup and run

Everything is dockerized. Run the below commands in the project directory.

```bash
docker-compose up -d # -d mean run in detached mode (in the background)
docker ps # display all running containers
```

Do some manual checks using

```bash

docker exec -t beginner_de_project_stream_kafka_1 kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server :9092  --topic server-logs --from-beginning --max-messages 10 # used to check the first 10 messages in the server-logs  topic
docker exec -t beginner_de_project_stream_kafka_1 kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server :9092  --topic alerts --from-beginning --max-messages 10 # used to check the first 10 messages in the alerts topic
```

and

```bash
pgcli -h localhost -p 5432 -U startdataengineer events
```
password is `password`

```sql
select * from server_log limit 5; -- should match the first 5 from the server-logs topic
select count(*) from server_log; -- 100000
\q -- to exit pgcli
```

take down all the running containers using down in the project repository

```bash
docker-compose down
